# No-show-Medical-Appointments
Final project in Udacity's Intro to Data Analysis course part of Data Analyst Nanodegree.
### Research question: What features (columns) are important to predict whether a patient is not going to show up to their scheduled medical appointment?

This analysis contains EDA, data wrangling, and hyperparameter tuning of a GBM model. It is all done in Python using sklearn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.
