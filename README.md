# No-Show Medical Appointments 

This project uses NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to explore a data set of Brazilian doctor appointments and corresponding no-show rate. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need an installation of Python and the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.
